# LNbits Demo
> For [MIT Bitcoin Hackathon 2025](https://mitbitcoin.devpost.com)


This repository serves as a demonstration of `LNbits` functionality.

## What's inside

The example project covers the basic LNbits functionality:
- **Account** creation
- **Wallet** create / fetch
- **Invoice** pay / create

However, the actual API provides a much broader set of tools that you can use in your project.
[Check it out](https://demo.lnbits.com/docs)

## Project overview

The most important files to see are in the `/src` directory.
There you'll find:
- `main.py` — a high-level demonstration of usage
- `models.py` — example entities in LNbits
- `service.py` — a Python class that makes requests to LNbits API
